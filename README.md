Task 4 - Firewall Configuration 
Reviewed Existing Firewall Rules

Assessed the current setup to see which types of traffic were permitted or restricted.

Blocked Telnet (Port 23)

Since Telnet is outdated and insecure, this step helped prevent unauthorized remote access.

Enabled SSH (Port 22)

Allowed secure remote management by ensuring SSH traffic could pass through the firewall.

Tested Configuration Changes

Confirmed that Telnet was successfully blocked and SSH remained accessible by simulating connection attempts.

Reverted to Original Settings

Removed the test changes to restore the firewallâ€™s original configuration and avoid unintended restrictions.
